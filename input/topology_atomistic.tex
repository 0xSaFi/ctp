\section{Atomistic topology}
\label{sec:atomistic}
\subsection{\gromacs topology}
If you are using \gromacs for generating atomistic configurations, it is possible to directly use the topology file provided by \gromacs (\texttt{topology.tpr}). In this case the residue and atom names should match those used  in the coarse-grained topology and conjugated segment definitions. 

\subsection{Custom topology}
The custom topology can also be defined using an \xml file. Moreover, it s possible to partially overwrite the information provided in, for example, \gromacs topology file. We will illustrate how to create a custom topology file using \dcvt. The structure of \dcvt, together with atom type definitions, is shown in fig.~\ref{fig:dcv2t_at}. \dcvt has two thiophene (THI) and two dicyanovinyl (NIT) residues. The pdb file which contains residue types, residue numbering, atom names, atom types, and atom coordinates is shown in listing~\ref{list:pdb}.
