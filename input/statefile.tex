Writes out the following pair properties to sqlite3 format:

 - Distance between sites i and j in the pair in nm.
 - Distance vector coordinates x,y,z in nm.
 - Transfer integral in eV (or the effective value if more frontier orbitals are involved)
 - Intramolecular reorganization energy in eV.
 - Outer sphere reorganization energy in eV.

Writes out the following site properties to sqlite3 format:

 - Site energy in eV
 - Site occupation probability
 - Coordinates x,y,z of the center of mass in nm
