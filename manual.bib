	abstract = {The mechanism of charge transport in organic materials is still controversial from both experimental and theoretical perspectives. At room temperature, molecular deformations interact strongly with the charge carrier both through intermolecular and intramolecular phonons, suggesting a thermally activated hopping mechanism as described by the Marcus electron transfer theory. However, several experimental measurements have indicated that the electronic transport behaves in a {\textquotedblleft}bandlike{\textquotedblright} manner, as indicated by a decrease in mobility with increasing temperature, in contradiction to the Marcus description. Bandlike first-principles calculations based on the {Holstein-Peierls} model tend to overestimate the charge mobility by about 2 orders of magnitude. Here, a hopping model is derived that not only quantitatively describes the charge mobility but also explains the observed bandlike behavior. This model uses the quantum version of charge-transfer theory coupled with a random-walk simulation of charge diffusion. The results bridge the gap between the two extreme mechanisms. This first-principles method predicts the room-temperature hole mobilities to be 2.4, 2.0, and 0.67 {cm2/V} s, for rubrene, pentacene, and tetracene, respectively, in good agreement with experiment.},

	abstract = {Theoretical investigations of charge transport in organic materials are generally based on the energy splitting in dimer method and routinely assume that the transport parameters (site energies and transfer integrals) determined from monomer and dimer calculations can be reliably used to describe extended systems. Here, we demonstrate that this transferability can fail even in molecular crystals with weak van der Waals intermolecular interactions, due to the substantial (but often ignored) impact of polarization effects, particularly on the site energies. We show that the neglect of electronic polarization leads to qualitatively incorrect values and trends for the transfer integrals computed with the energy splitting method, even in simple prototypes such as ethylene or pentacene dimers. The polarization effect in these systems is largely electrostatic in nature and can change dramatically upon transition from a dimer to an extended system. For example, the difference in site energy for a prototypical face-to-edge one-dimensional stack of pentacene molecules is calculated to be 30\% greater than that in the face-to-edge dimer, whereas the site energy difference in the pentacene crystal is vanishingly small. Importantly, when computed directly in the framework of localized monomer orbitals, the transfer integral values for dimer and extended systems are very similar.},

	abstract = {Molecular force fields have been approaching a generational transition over the past several years, moving away from well-established and well-tuned, but intrinsically limited, fixed point charge models toward more intricate and expensive polarizable models that should allow more accurate description of molecular properties. The recently introduced {AMOEBA} force field is a leading publicly available example of this next generation of theoretical model, but to date, it has only received relatively limited validation, which we address here. We show that the {AMOEBA} force field is in fact a significant improvement over fixed charge models for small molecule structural and thermodynamic observables in particular, although further fine-tuning is necessary to describe solvation free energies of drug-like small molecules, dynamical properties away from ambient conditions, and possible improvements in aromatic interactions. State of the art electronic structure calculations reveal generally very good agreement with {AMOEBA} for demanding problems such as relative conformational energies of the alanine tetrapeptide and isomers of water sulfate complexes. {AMOEBA} is shown to be especially successful on protein-ligand binding and computational X-ray crystallography where polarization and accurate electrostatics are critical.},

The relative order of computed mobilities agrees with the observed trend, and the largest mobility is computed for the planar {PBI} derivative. It is suggested that thermally induced disorder effects should contribute considerably to the observed large mobility of the planar {PBI} derivative, while a retardation effect induced by the presence of alternating slow and fast jumps along ?-stacked {PBI} columns is responsible for the lower mobilities of the two twisted derivatives.

Morphologies are generated using an all-atom force field, while charge dynamics is simulated within the framework of high-temperature nonadiabatic Marcus theory or using semiclassical dynamics. We conclude that, on the length scales reachable by molecular dynamics simulations, the charge transport in bulk molecular crystals is mostly limited by the dynamic disorder, while in self-assembled monolayers the static disorder, which is due to the slow motion of the side chains, enhances charge localization and influences the transport dynamics. We find that the presence of disorder can either reduce or increase charge carrier mobility, depending on the dimensionality of the charge percolation network. The advantages of charge transporting materials with two- or three-dimensional networks are clearly shown.},

By combining wide-angle X-ray scattering experiments with molecular dynamics simulations, we elucidate packing motifs of a perylene tetracarboxdiimide derivative, a task which is hard to achieve by using a single experimental or theoretical technique. We then relate the charge mobility to the molecular arrangement, both by pulse-radiolysis time-resolved microwave conductivity experiments and simulations based on the non-adiabatic Marcus charge transfer theory. Our results indicate that the helical molecular arrangement with the 45{\textdegree} twist angle between the neighboring molecules favors hole transport in a compound normally considered as an n-type semiconductor. Statistical analysis shows that the transport is strongly suppressed by structural defects.

Several coarse-graining techniques have so far been developed, such as iterative Boltzmann inversion, force-matching, and inverse Monte Carlo. However, there is no unified framework that implements these methods and that allows their direct comparison. We present a versatile object-oriented toolkit for coarse-graining applications {(VOTCA)} that implements these techniques and that provides a flexible modular platform for the further development of coarse-graining techniques. All methods are illustrated and compared by coarse-graining the {SPC/E} water model, liquid methanol, liquid propane, and a single molecule of hexane.},

	abstract = {It has recently been demonstrated that the hopping mobility in semiconducting organic materials depends on the charge-carrier concentration. We have analyzed this effect within the framework of six existing semianalytical models, for the case of a Gaussian density of states {(DOS).} These models were either not applied earlier to the case of a Gaussian {DOS}, or are shown to require a major modification. The mobility is constant below a certain concentration, which decreases with increasing ratio s? of the width of the {DOS} over the thermal energy {kBT}, and it increases for larger concentrations. At very high concentrations final state effects limit this increase or even give rise to a decrease. An analytical expression is given for the mobility, ?, in the form of the product of the mobility in the low concentration limit times a concentration (c) and s?-dependent enhancement factor. Depending on c, ln(?) varies approximately linearly with {1/T} or with {1/T2.} This finding may lead to a solution for the long-standing controversy between polaron-based and disorder-based hopping models.},

We propose a method for extrapolating a macroscopic nondispersive mobility from the temperature dependence of a microscopic one. The method is tested on an amorphous phase of tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum, for which the temperature dependence of a microscopic hole mobility is obtained by combining molecular-dynamics simulations for generating material morphologies, electronic-structure calculations for determining charge hopping rates, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations for studying charge dynamics. The extracted value of the nondispersive mobility and its electric field dependence agree well with the results of time-of-flight experiments.},
