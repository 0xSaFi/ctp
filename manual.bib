	abstract = {In this article, we discuss a method for calculating transfer integrals for pairs of molecules based on Zerner's Independent Neglect of Differential Overlap Hamiltonian which requires only a single self-consistent field calculation on an isolated molecule to be performed to determine the transfer integral for a pair of molecules. This method is compared with results obtained by projection of the pair of molecules' molecular orbitals onto the vector space defined by the molecular orbitals of each isolated molecule. The two methods are found to be in good agreement using three compounds as model systems: pentacene, ethylene, and hexabenzocoronene. {\textcopyright} 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Theoretical investigations of charge transport in organic materials are generally based on the energy splitting in dimer method and routinely assume that the transport parameters (site energies and transfer integrals) determined from monomer and dimer calculations can be reliably used to describe extended systems. Here, we demonstrate that this transferability can fail even in molecular crystals with weak van der Waals intermolecular interactions, due to the substantial (but often ignored) impact of polarization effects, particularly on the site energies. We show that the neglect of electronic polarization leads to qualitatively incorrect values and trends for the transfer integrals computed with the energy splitting method, even in simple prototypes such as ethylene or pentacene dimers. The polarization effect in these systems is largely electrostatic in nature and can change dramatically upon transition from a dimer to an extended system. For example, the difference in site energy for a prototypical face-to-edge one-dimensional stack of pentacene molecules is calculated to be 30\% greater than that in the face-to-edge dimer, whereas the site energy difference in the pentacene crystal is vanishingly small. Importantly, when computed directly in the framework of localized monomer orbitals, the transfer integral values for dimer and extended systems are very similar.},

This effect destroys the translational symmetry of the electronic Hamiltonian and makes the band description inadequate for {RT} organic crystals. We used a one-dimensional semiclassical model to compute the (temperature dependent) charge carrier mobility in the presence of thermal fluctuations of the electronic Hamiltonian.

Both site energies and transfer integrals are distributed because of disorder in the molecular arrangement. It is shown that the contributions to the site energies from polarization and electrostatic effects are of opposite sign for positive charges. We look at three mesophases of hexabenzocoronene: herringbone, discotic, and columnar disordered.

A phenomenological Gill{\textquoteright}s relation occurs in the intermediate region of the S-shaped field dependence of the mobility. The recently observed anomalous field dependence of the mobility, which shows that the mobility increases with field strength at low fields, passes through a maximum, and then decreases with increasing field strength, is reproduced.

Only such transitions are essential in systems with strongly correlated space-energy distributions of localized states [see K. Kohary et al., following paper, Phys. Rev. B 63, 094202 (2001)]. Comparison is given for results obtained with symmetrical and asymmetrical transition rates. It is shown that mesoscopic effects play an essential role even for rather long chains with hundreds of localization sites. Moreover, not only the magnitude of the drift mobility, but also its temperature dependence is influenced by the chain length.

	abstract = {From a numerical solution of the master equation for hopping transport in a disordered energy landscape with a Gaussian density of states, we determine the dependence of the charge-carrier mobility on temperature, carrier density, and electric field. Experimental current-voltage characteristics in devices based on semiconducting polymers are excellently reproduced with this unified description of the mobility. At room temperature it is mainly the dependence on carrier density that plays an important role, whereas at low temperatures and high fields the electric field dependence becomes important. Omission in the past of the carrier-density dependence has led to an underestimation of the hopping distance and the width of the density of states in these polymers.},

Morphologies are generated using an all-atom force field, while charge dynamics is simulated within the framework of high-temperature nonadiabatic Marcus theory or using semiclassical dynamics. We conclude that, on the length scales reachable by molecular dynamics simulations, the charge transport in bulk molecular crystals is mostly limited by the dynamic disorder, while in self-assembled monolayers the static disorder, which is due to the slow motion of the side chains, enhances charge localization and influences the transport dynamics. We find that the presence of disorder can either reduce or increase charge carrier mobility, depending on the dimensionality of the charge percolation network. The advantages of charge transporting materials with two- or three-dimensional networks are clearly shown.},

It is impossible to describe charge transport using either static disorder models or temperature averaged electronic Hamiltonians. We build a model Hamiltonian which allows the study of charge transport whenever carrier and nuclear dynamics are not easily separable. Performing nanoseconds long molecular dynamics of a columnar mesophase of a discotic liquid crystal and evaluating electronic couplings, we identify realistic parameters of the Hamiltonian. All modes which are coupled to the electron dynamics can be described in the model Hamiltonian by a limited number of Langevin oscillators. This method can be applied to systems with both slow (nanoseconds) and fast (hundreds of femtoseconds) nuclear motions, i.e., with both dynamic and static disorder.},

We present a versatile object-oriented toolkit for coarse-graining applications {(VOTCA)} that implements these techniques and that provides a flexible modular platform for the further development of coarse-graining techniques.

The method is tested on an amorphous phase of tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum, for which the temperature dependence of a microscopic hole mobility is obtained by combining molecular-dynamics simulations for generating material morphologies, electronic-structure calculations for determining charge hopping rates, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations for studying charge dynamics. The extracted value of the nondispersive mobility and its electric field dependence agree well with the results of time-of-flight experiments.},

The injection-barrier lowering due to the image potential is taken into account, so that the model provides a comprehensive treatment of the space-charge-limited current as well as the injection-limited current {(ILC)} regimes. We show that the current distribution can be highly filamentary for voltages, layer thicknesses, and disorder strengths that are realistic for organic light-emitting diodes and, that, as a result, the current density in both regimes can be significantly larger than as obtained from a one-dimensional continuum drift-diffusion device model. For devices with large injection barriers and strong disorder, in the {ILC} transport regime, good agreement is obtained with the average current density predicted from a model assuming injection and transport via one-dimensional filaments {[A.} L.
