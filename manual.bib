	abstract = {In this article, we discuss a method for calculating transfer integrals for pairs of molecules based on Zerner's Independent Neglect of Differential Overlap Hamiltonian which requires only a single self-consistent field calculation on an isolated molecule to be performed to determine the transfer integral for a pair of molecules. This method is compared with results obtained by projection of the pair of molecules' molecular orbitals onto the vector space defined by the molecular orbitals of each isolated molecule. The two methods are found to be in good agreement using three compounds as model systems: pentacene, ethylene, and hexabenzocoronene. {\textcopyright} 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We find that at temperatures T {\textless} Tc, the critical temperature, the new technique is faster than the standard technique, being ten times faster at T = 0.588 Tc. We expect that the new technique will be especially valuable in Monte Carlo simulation of the time evolution of binary alloy systems. The new algorithm is essentially a reorganization of the standard algorithm. It accounts for the a priori probability of changing spins before, rather than after, choosing the spin or spins to change.},

The time dependence of fluctuations in transfer integrals shows that static disorder is predominant in determining charge transport characteristics. Both site energies and transfer integrals are distributed because of disorder in the molecular arrangement. It is shown that the contributions to the site energies from polarization and electrostatic effects are of opposite sign for positive charges. We look at three mesophases of hexabenzocoronene: herringbone, discotic, and columnar disordered. All results are compared to time resolved microwave conductivity data and show excellent agreement with no fitting parameters. {(C)} 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

Several coarse-graining techniques have so far been developed, such as iterative Boltzmann inversion, force-matching, and inverse Monte Carlo. However, there is no unified framework that implements these methods and that allows their direct comparison. We present a versatile object-oriented toolkit for coarse-graining applications {(VOTCA)} that implements these techniques and that provides a flexible modular platform for the further development of coarse-graining techniques. All methods are illustrated and compared by coarse-graining the {SPC/E} water model, liquid methanol, liquid propane, and a single molecule of hexane.},
