\section{Conjugated segments and rigid fragments}

\caption{\small The concept of conjugated segments and rigid fragments. Dashed lines indicate conjugated segments while colors denote rigid fragments. (a) Hexabenzocoronene: the $\pi$-conjugated system is both a rigid fragment and a conjugated segment. (b) \Alq: the Al atom and each ligand are rigid fragments while the whole molecule is a conjugated segment. (c) Polythiophene: each repeat unit is a rigid fragment. A conjugated segment consists of one or more rigid fragments. One molecule can have several conjugated segments.}

With the morphology at hand, the next step is partitioning the system on hopping sites, or conjugated segments, and calculating charge transfer rates between them. Physically intuitive arguments can be used for the partitioning,  which reflects the localization of the wave function of a charge. For most organic semiconductors, the molecular architecture includes relatively rigid, planar $\pi$-conjugated systems, which we will refer to as rigid fragments. A conjugated segment can contain one or more of such rigid fragments, which are linked by bonded degrees of freedom. The dynamics of these degrees of freedom evolves on timescales much slower than the frequency of the internal promoting mode. In some cases, e.g. glasses, it can be `frozen' due to non-bonded interactions with the surrounding molecules.

To illustrate the concept of conjugated segments and rigid fragments, three representative molecular architectures are shown in \fig{segment}. The first one is a typical discotic liquid crystal, hexabenzocoronene. It consists of a conjugated core to which side chains are attached to aid self-assembly and solution processing. In this case the orbitals localized on side chains do not participate in charge transport and the conjugated $\pi$-system is both, a rigid fragment and a conjugated segment. 
%
In \Alq, a metal-coordinated compound, a charge carrier is delocalized over all three ligands. Hence, the whole molecule is one conjugated segment. Individual ligands are relatively rigid, while energies of the order of $k_\text{B}T$ are sufficient to reorient them with respect to each other. Thus the Al atom and the three ligands are rigid fragments.
%
In the case of a conjugated polymer, one molecule can consist of several conjugated segments, while each backbone repeat unit is a rigid fragment. Since the conjugation along the backbone can be broken due to large out-of-plane twists between two repeat units, an empirical criterion, based on the dihedral angle, can be used to partition the backbone on conjugated segments~\cite{ruehle_multiscale_2010}. However, such intuitive partitioning is, to some extent, arbitrary and shall be validated by other methods~\cite{vukmirovi_charge_2008,vukmirovi_charge_2009,mcmahon_ad_2009}. 

After partitioning, an additional step is often required to remove bond length fluctuations introduced by molecular dynamics simulations, since they are already integrated out in the derivation of the rate expression. This is achieved by substituting respective molecular fragments with  rigid, planar $\pi$-systems optimized using first-principles methods. Centers of mass and gyration tensors are used to align rigid fragments, though a custom definition of local axes is also possible. Such a procedure also minimizes discrepancies between the force-field and first-principles-based ground state geometries of conjugated segments, which might be important for calculations of electronic couplings, reorganization energies, and intramolecular driving forces. 

Finally, a list of neighboring conjugated segments is constructed. Two segments are added to this list if the distance between centers of mass of {\em any} their rigid fragments is below a certain cutoff. This allows neighbors to be selected on a criterion of minimum distance of approach rather than center of mass distance, which is useful for molecules with anisotropic shapes.

\section{Mapping the system onto conjugated segments}

\ctpmap partitions the system on conjugated segments and rigid fragments:
\begin{verbatim}
  ctp_map --top topology.tpr -c 15 -cg cgmap.xml --trj traj.trr
\end{verbatim}
The input are the gromacs topology and trajectory files, a mapping file, a cutoff distance for defining nearest neighbours and a file describing the charge unit types. The output includes a neighbour list, labelled by the gromacs step number, and a binary 
file and a state file with the mapped onto conjugated segments system. 

In order to check the mapping one can use the \dumptraj calculator
\begin{verbatim}
  ctp_run --exec  "dumptraj" -cg map.xml 
\end{verbatim}

This program will read in the state file created by \ctpmap together with a conjugated segment definitions and will create two output trajectory files corresponding to the coarse-grained and back-mapped topologies. The back-maping of the coase-grained topology is performed using stored rigid fragment positions and orientations. It is suggested to view all three trajectories (atomistic, coarse grained, and quantum) on top of each other to check the mapping.

\subsection{The mapping file}
To partition the system onto conjugated segments and rigid fragments a mapping \xml file is required. This file is based on the input provided for generation of \texttt{topol.tpr} and \texttt{traj.trr} files. An example of a mapping file for a single \dcvt molecule is shown in listing~\ref{list:map}. 

%\begin{table}
{\small 
\begin{tabular}{p{3cm} p{10cm}}
\xml tag & Description \\
\hline
\texttt{name} & Name of the molecule in the coarse-grained model. Useful for multicomponent systems. \\
%
\texttt{ident} & Name (identification) of the molecule in the all-atom representation. This \emph{must} match the molecule name in the atomistic representation (e.g. \gromacs topology). \\
%
\texttt{topology} & Section describing the partitioning of the molecule on rigid fragments. Atom and residue names/types \emph{must} correspond to those used in the atomistic representation (e.g. \gromacs topology)\\
& \\
\texttt{cg\_beads} & Section describing all rigid fragments of a molecule. \\
%
\texttt{cg\_bead} & Section defining one particular rigid fragment. \\
%
\texttt{cg\_bead.name} &  The name of the bead. This must be unique for each rigid fragment in a molecule, for example a polymer made of ten repeat units needs ten different name identifiers if each repeat unit is a rigid fragment. \\
%
\texttt{cg\_bead.type} &  The type of the rigid fragment. This may be the same for beads which only differ by a hydrogen atom or two to simplify the calculations, while the mapping must take these differences into account. \\
%
\texttt{cg\_bead.mapping} & The type of the mapping. Different beads may have the same mapping, since a molecule may contain multiple beads of the same type, but in the bead definition each must correspond to different atoms. \\
%
\texttt{cg\_bead.beads} &  List of all atoms belonging to the rigid fragment in the format \texttt{residue number:residue name:atom name}. Depending on the options, the first three atoms might be used to calculate vectors defining the orientation of the rigid fragment. In this case they must not lie on the same axis. Even though the first three atoms in the mapping need not correspond to the first three atoms in the \texttt{*.rtp} or \texttt{*.gro} files, the order must be consistent with the definitions in the \texttt{list\_charges} file. \\
%
\texttt{cg\_bead.symmetry} &  The symmetry of the molecule. \texttt{symmetry = 3} corresponds to a fragment with three different moments of inertia of the mass tensor. Used to automatically determine fragment orientation.\\
& \\
\texttt{qm} & This section associates rigid fragments (beads) with a particular type of a conjugated segment. \\
%
\texttt{qm.crgunitname} &  The name of the conjugated segment the fragment is associated with. \\
%
\texttt{qm.bead} & The position of the rigid fragment in the conjugated segment. \\
& \\
\texttt{maps} & Section describing maps for all types of rigid fragments. Maps are used to determine the position of a rigid fragment. \\
%
\texttt{map} &  Section defining one particular map. \\
%
\texttt{map.name} & The map name must correspond to the name used to define the fragments (\texttt{cg\_beads.mapping} tag) . \\
%
\texttt{map.weights} & The weighting of the atoms in the rigid fragment. If the mass of the nucleus in atomic mass units is used, the center of the rigid fragment will be its center of mass. The weights must be in the same order as in the corresponding rigid fragment definition (\texttt{cg\_beads.bead} tag).

 \texttt{energy} & Site energy of the conjugated segment. \\
 \texttt{monomer\_atom\_map} &
 List of atom indices as they were specified in the \gaussian input used to create the \orb file. 
 Note: The first three values are important, since they must correspond to the first three atoms defined in the coarse-grained mapping, which are used to calculate two vectors indicating the orientation of the molecule. The third required vector is the eigenvector of the smallest eigenvalue of the gyration tensor, i.e. perpendicular to the planar core.
 Note: The number of molecules here may differ from that in the coarse-grained mapping, since for example only the core is important for transport and not the side chains, but it has to be the same number of atoms as in the \gaussian input file otherwise overlap integral values will be terribly wrong.
