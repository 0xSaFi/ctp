Morphologies are generated using an all-atom force field, while charge dynamics is simulated within the framework of high-temperature nonadiabatic Marcus theory or using semiclassical dynamics. We conclude that, on the length scales reachable by molecular dynamics simulations, the charge transport in bulk molecular crystals is mostly limited by the dynamic disorder, while in self-assembled monolayers the static disorder, which is due to the slow motion of the side chains, enhances charge localization and influences the transport dynamics. We find that the presence of disorder can either reduce or increase charge carrier mobility, depending on the dimensionality of the charge percolation network. The advantages of charge transporting materials with two- or three-dimensional networks are clearly shown.},

	abstract = {Partial disorder is an inherent property of self-assembled organic semiconductors that complicates their rational design, because electronic structure, self-assembling properties, and stability all have to be accounted for simultaneously. Therefore, the understanding of charge transport mechanisms in these systems is still in its infancy. A theoretical study of charge transport in organic semiconductors was performed on self-assembled layers of [1]benzothieno[3,2-b]benzothiophene functionalized with alkyl side chains. Analysis showed that semiclassical dynamics misses static (on time scales of charge transport) disorder while the solution of the master equation combined with the high-temperature limit Marcus theory for charge transfer rates does not take into account molecular dynamic modes relaxing on a time scale of charge hopping. A comparison between predictions based on a perfectly ordered and a realistic crystal structure reveals the strong influence of static and dynamic disorder. The advantage of two-dimensional charge transporting materials over one-dimensional ones is clearly shown. The Marcus theory-based prediction of 0.1 cm2 V-1 s-1 is in good agreement with our {FET} mobility of 0.22 cm2 V-1 s-1, which is an order of magnitude lower than that reported in the literature {[Ebata,} H.; et al.

	abstract = {We model charge transport in disordered semiconducting polymers by hopping of charges on a regular cubic lattice of sites. A large on-site Coulomb repulsion prohibits double occupancy of the sites. Disorder is introduced by taking random site energies from a Gaussian distribution. Recently, it was demonstrated that this model leads to a dependence of the charge-carrier mobilities on the density of charge carriers that is in agreement with experimental observations. The model is conveniently solved within a mean-field approximation, in which the correlation between the occupational probabilities of different sites is neglected. This approximation becomes exact in the limit of vanishing charge-carrier densities, but needs to be checked at high densities. We perform this check by dividing the lattice in pairs of neighboring sites and taking into account the correlation between the sites within each pair explicitly. This pair approximation is expected to account for the most important corrections to the mean-field approximation. We study the effects of varying temperature, charge-carrier density, and electric field. We demonstrate that in the parameter regime relevant for semiconducting polymers used in practical devices the corrections to the mobilities calculated from the mean-field approximation will not exceed a few percent, so that this approximation can be safely used.},

Here, we demonstrate that this transferability can fail even in molecular crystals with weak van der Waals intermolecular interactions, due to the substantial (but often ignored) impact of polarization effects, particularly on the site energies. We show that the neglect of electronic polarization leads to qualitatively incorrect values and trends for the transfer integrals computed with the energy splitting method, even in simple prototypes such as ethylene or pentacene dimers. The polarization effect in these systems is largely electrostatic in nature and can change dramatically upon transition from a dimer to an extended system. For example, the difference in site energy for a prototypical face-to-edge one-dimensional stack of pentacene molecules is calculated to be 30\% greater than that in the face-to-edge dimer, whereas the site energy difference in the pentacene crystal is vanishingly small. Importantly, when computed directly in the framework of localized monomer orbitals, the transfer integral values for dimer and extended systems are very similar.},

Cells made with a single polymer and two electrodes tend to be inefficient because the photogenerated excitons are usually not split by the built-in electric field, which arises from differences in the electrode work functions. The efficiency can be increased by splitting the excitons at an interface between two semiconductors with offset energy levels. Power conversion efficiencies of almost 4\% have been achieved by blending polymers with electron-accepting materials such as C60 derivatives, cadmium selenide, and titanium dioxide. We predict that efficiencies higher than 10\% can be achieved by optimizing the cell's architecture to promote efficient exciton splitting and charge transport and by reducing the band gap of the polymer so that a larger fraction of the solar spectrum can be absorbed.},

The calculations are based on a master-equation approach, assuming a Gaussian distribution of site energies without spatial correlations. The injection-barrier lowering due to the image potential is taken into account, so that the model provides a comprehensive treatment of the space-charge-limited current as well as the injection-limited current {(ILC)} regimes. We show that the current distribution can be highly filamentary for voltages, layer thicknesses, and disorder strengths that are realistic for organic light-emitting diodes and, that, as a result, the current density in both regimes can be significantly larger than as obtained from a one-dimensional continuum drift-diffusion device model. For devices with large injection barriers and strong disorder, in the {ILC} transport regime, good agreement is obtained with the average current density predicted from a model assuming injection and transport via one-dimensional filaments {[A.} L.

Our work is devoted to the making of microcavities centered at 2.4 {eV} (515 nm) formed by two {TiO2/SiO2} distributed Bragg reflectors, surrounding an emitting layer. The emitting layer is an organic semiconductor (tri-hydroxyquinoline-aluminum, Alq3) chosen for its strong luminescent efficiency. For the fabrication of such complex structure, the layer optical path length is an determining parameter to obtain a high quality microcavity. First, a particular attention has been paid to the characterization of the optical properties of the active layer and the mirror layers. Optical indices have been obtained by means of spectroellipsometry. Alq3 and {TiO2} dispersion laws were successfully modeled with a model developed by Forohoui and Bloomer. Secondly, we applied in situ ellipsometry to control the mirror layer deposition. Finally, we show that this method allows microcavity fabrication with good accuracy.},

The recently introduced {AMOEBA} force field is a leading publicly available example of this next generation of theoretical model, but to date, it has only received relatively limited validation, which we address here. We show that the {AMOEBA} force field is in fact a significant improvement over fixed charge models for small molecule structural and thermodynamic observables in particular, although further fine-tuning is necessary to describe solvation free energies of drug-like small molecules, dynamical properties away from ambient conditions, and possible improvements in aromatic interactions. State of the art electronic structure calculations reveal generally very good agreement with {AMOEBA} for demanding problems such as relative conformational energies of the alanine tetrapeptide and isomers of water sulfate complexes. {AMOEBA} is shown to be especially successful on protein-ligand binding and computational X-ray crystallography where polarization and accurate electrostatics are critical.},

At room temperature it is mainly the dependence on carrier density that plays an important role, whereas at low temperatures and high fields the electric field dependence becomes important.

The calculated molecular results are compared with measurements on dense solid-state films of Alq. We specifically consider: the optical absorption spectrum near the fundamental absorption threshold, the ionization potential, the single-particle energy gap, the static dielectric constant, and the electric-field dependence of the electron mobility. We find that the molecular calculations can describe the optical absorption spectrum near the fundamental absorption threshold without significant corrections for solid-state effects. The energies of the triplet excited states are computed and the lowest triplet is found to lie 0.64 {eV} below the lowest excited singlet state. In contrast, large dielectric corrections must be included for the molecular calculations to describe the ionization potential and single-particle energy gap. When these dielectric corrections are made, using the calculated molecular polarizability, which accurately gives the measured static dielectric constant, both the ionization potential and single-particle energy gap are well described. The calculated molecular dipole moment can be used to interpret the electric-field dependence of the electron mobility. The solid-state properties, determined from the molecular calculations, are then used in a device model to describe the measured current-voltage characteristics in Alq diodes.},

By using density functional theory and gas-phase ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, we investigate the microscopic charge transport parameters of the pentathienoacene crystal. We find that the valence band exhibits a stronger dispersion than those in the pentacene and rubrene single crystals with marked uniaxial characteristics within the molecular layer due to the presence of one-dimensional ?-stacks; a small hole effective mass is also found along the direction perpendicular to the molecular layers. In the conduction band, strong intermolecular sulfur-sulfur interactions give rise to a significant interstack electronic coupling whereas the intrastack dispersion is greatly reduced. The intramolecular vibronic coupling (reorganization energy) is stronger than that in pentacene but comparable to that in sexithiophene; it is larger for holes than for electrons, as a result of low-frequency modes induced by the sulfur atoms. The polarization energy is large, but its effect on the vibronic coupling remains small. Charge transport is discussed in the framework of both band and hopping models.},

Charge transfer rates are computed within the {Marcus-Levich-Jortner} formalism including a single effective mode treated quantum mechanically and are injected in a kinetic Monte Carlo scheme to propagate the charge carrier in the crystal and to estimate charge mobilities at room temperature. The relative order of computed mobilities agrees with the observed trend, and the largest mobility is computed for the planar {PBI} derivative. It is suggested that thermally induced disorder effects should contribute considerably to the observed large mobility of the planar {PBI} derivative, while a retardation effect induced by the presence of alternating slow and fast jumps along ?-stacked {PBI} columns is responsible for the lower mobilities of the two twisted derivatives. The computed parameters reveal the subtle interplay between intramolecular and intermolecular contributions to the charge carrier propagation in these organic semiconductors and may guide the design of more efficient architectures.},

	abstract = {Discotic mesophases are known for their ability to self-assemble into columnar structures and can serve as semiconducting molecular wires. Charge carrier mobility along these wires strongly depends on molecular packing, which is controlled by intermolecular interactions. By combining wide-angle X-ray scattering experiments with molecular dynamics simulations, we elucidate packing motifs of a perylene tetracarboxdiimide derivative, a task which is hard to achieve by using a single experimental or theoretical technique. We then relate the charge mobility to the molecular arrangement, both by pulse-radiolysis time-resolved microwave conductivity experiments and simulations based on the non-adiabatic Marcus charge transfer theory. Our results indicate that the helical molecular arrangement with the 45{\textdegree} twist angle between the neighboring molecules favors hole transport in a compound normally considered as an n-type semiconductor. Statistical analysis shows that the transport is strongly suppressed by structural defects. By linking molecular packing and mobility, we eventually provide a pathway to the rational design of perylenediimide derivatives with high charge mobilities.},

developed a theoretical scheme to employ the Marcus electron transfer
theory coupled with a direct diabatic dimer model and the Brownian
diffusion assumption to predict the carrier mobility for molecular
materials. For triphenylamine, a typical molecular transport material,
the design strategies regarding the formation a cyclic or a linear
dimer are evaluated from theoretical calculations for the carrier
mobility. We made a comparison between the mobility and the electrical
polarizability. It is found that in the case of triphenylamine dimer,
these two quantities have different trends. The fact that the
macrocycle possesses higher mobility but lower polarizability than the
linear chain is due to the difference in the reorganization energy.
The theoretical predicted temperature dependences are analysed within
the hopping mechanism. The calculated room-temperature mobilities are
in reasonable agreement with experimental values.},

Collision-cascade simulation in the associated body-centered-cubic (bcc) and face-centered-cubic (fcc) arrays of atoms was based on the approximation of assuming a branching sequence of binary-collisions. The primary knock-on atom {(PKA)} displacement efficiency was found to be a decreasing function of {PKA} energy, in contrast to the constant displacement efficiency given by structureless solid models. This effect was caused predominantly by damage-production interference among different parts of the cascade. Long-range channeling (range >= 1000 \r{A}) played a very minor role in the decrease of the {PKA} displacement efficiency with increasing {PKA} energy, in bcc metals and none at all in copper. Quasichanneling events were common and greatly influenced the development of a displacement spike along ?110? directions in bcc metals. In this regard, the dimensions of a cascade were determined by the ranges of quasichanneled higher order knock-on atoms in the cascade rather than by the {PKA} range. The preferred directions for long-range self-channeling were also ?110?. The calculations suggest that in ?-iron and tungsten, only those displacement spikes that would contain clusters of >= 10 vacancies at an irradiation temperature of {0{\textdegree}K} survive thermal annealing at room-temperature irradiation. Specifically, this means that only those spikes produced by {PKA} with energies above 3 {keV} in ? iron and above 6 {keV} in tungsten would contribute surviving defects. The density of displacements in a spike produced at {0{\textdegree}K} in ? iron was saturated at all {PKA} energies considered (0.5-20 {keV).} The temperature dependence of the shape and size of the interstitial-vacancy recombination region in ?-iron was determined in part.},

	abstract = {Characterization of the electronically polarized environment and the nuclear relaxation that accompanies charge carriers is fundamental to charge transport in crystalline, polycrystalline, and amorphous organic solids. To study the polarization effects of localized charged carriers, we use quantum/classical {QM/MM} approaches with charge redistribution and polarizable force field schemes and apply them to crystals of naphthalene through pentacene. We describe the results of a comprehensive investigation of the electronic polarization energies in molecular crystal structures of these oligoacenes and discuss as well the evolution of the nuclear relaxation energies calculated for model oligoacene systems.},

First, a generalization of the nonadiabatic {Marcus-Levich-Dogonadze} rate expression is obtained for the case of different forward and backward reorganization energies. Second, we provide a corresponding generalization of the Zusman rate expression which bridges between nonadiabatic and solvent controlled adiabatic electron transfer. The derived analytical rate expressions compare favorably against the precise numerics. A detailed comparison with previous work of Tang is presented.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
