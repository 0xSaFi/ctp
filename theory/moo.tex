\subsection{Semi-empirical methods}
\label{sec:moo}

\newcommand{\moo}{MOO\xspace}

The main advantage of the molecular orbital overlap \moo library is {\em fast} evaluation of electronic coupling elements. A detailed description of the method is provided in ref.~\cite{kirkpatrick_approximate_2008}. Please site this paper if you are using the method. Note that \moo is based on the semi-empirical ZINDO Hamiltonian and therefore has limited applicability. The general advice is to first compare the accuracy of the \moo method to the DFT-based calculations.
